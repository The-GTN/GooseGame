If you're reading that, you've been granted to access to my OOP projects.
Use the clone option of this OPP folder and create a local folder, if it's not already done.

Open a shell from this local folder, the **git pull** command is recommended for each times you come back to this work.

From the root of this work folder, in a shell, you could use this differents commands :

* **make** : run the `executable` of this project
* **make comp** : build the differents `classes`
* **make compTest** : build the `testing classes`
* **make doc** : create the `documentation`
* **make test** : make the differents `tests`
* **make extract** : extract the classes from the `.jar` files
* **make exe** : create the `executables`
* **make goosegame** : run the `executable` of this project
* **make io** : run the second `executable`
* **make clean** : delete all the `.class` files, the `docs` folder and the extracted files created with `make extract`
